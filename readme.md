# Top Hat Tagger ([download](https://github.com/lewisforbes/Top-Hat-Tagger/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))

This program requires [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to run. It can cause destrictive actions if run wrong, and the <kbd>Esc</kbd> can be pressed when the script is running to kill it.

Run [main.py](/main.py) to generate the script [tagger.ahk](/tagger.ahk). Run the script and click on the first question in a folder to begin the tagging.
